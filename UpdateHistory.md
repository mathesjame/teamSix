Update History log.
(This is basically a running history log, to help with where we are at,
what has been done/hasn't been done. What we need to do. Plans, etc. 
This will also help with our report that we need to submit)

AVC challenge (team name here)
Members: Josh, James, Jordan, Moses, Ethan(?)

Overall plan - To create an autonomous robot to navigate a maze.

Inital Plan Doc (nearly completed) - due 5/5/17 - by midnight.
Followed up with everyone about signatures, all completed now - Josh

(Feel free to add/change/modify... Just setting up initially, off top of my head.)

Software: (Added to repo, what we have, what we need, who is doing what, list of things to be done)
  - Added some code to the repo that might be useful for later in the AVC project, mentioned this on the Google Doc as well. (Jordan)
Software Design: (stuff here)

Hardware: (stuff here)

Hardware Design: (Drawings?, other stuff?) - would be good to have uploaded pictures of designs, can add these to reports also.
  - Can't find a way to add pictures to this; however have uploaded the concept sketches I did a while ago to the Google Doc. (Jordan)
(Add other stuff)

Maybe if adding specific stuff you have done, add your name at the end so we can see who has done it/who said what, 
if we need to follow up with specific person, etc.
